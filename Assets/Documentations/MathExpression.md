Requirements:
1. If it is an equation, users can drag terms to the other side. <br>
For example, the user dragged the sin2B term from left to right in the equation "\frac{sinA-1}{sinB}=2cosB".<br>
It will become "sinA-1=2cosBsinB".
2. For each term, user should be able to expand the terms and combine terms by distributive laws.
3. Formula can be dragged to terms and transform terms into another form.
